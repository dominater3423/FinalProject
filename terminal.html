		<p id="ParagraphPadded">First off I should say if you use Linux you should be using the terminal. The thing that separates Linux and Windows is that Linux was build from the ground up to be run from the command line, compared to in Windows where it was largely an afterthought playing second fiddle to the gui. On Linux you can to everything quickly and efficiently all with a few commands. Once you get over the shock and get comfortable in the command line, I guarantee you will find yourself preferring it and find yourself frustrated when you have to work with frustrating guis. To access the terminal it requires a terminal emulator, this just emulates a text environment when you are logged in to a display server. The three I can vouch for is gnome-terminal for noobies, then urxvt and st for for the more advanced. Now to not complicate things we will only be working in the home directory. That is located in /home/user and where the Downloads, Documents, etc. is located.</p>
