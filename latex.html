		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>This is an alternative way to create presentations faster and more professionally. For those of you who don't know what Latex is, according to their website "LaTeX, which is pronounced «Lah-tech» or «Lay-tech» (to rhyme with «blech» or «Bertolt Brecht»), is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing." Essentially you type up the document using Latex's syntax and then compile it to the format you wish. Most commonly people will use pdflatex but there are various options. In this tutorial I'll be showing you how to create a presentation compiled into a pdf. Enough of that though, let's get into installing Latex. I'll only cover the installation for Linux, but I'm sure with a bit of googling you can figure it out if you plebs are either on Mac or Windows.</p>
		<h3>Installation</h3>
		<p>In many distros, like Debian and Arch, an entire Latex distribution is available to download through the repositories, so first check there. If unavailable though we will cover installing through Tex Live.</p>	
		<p>Debian -> sudo apt-get install texlive-full</p>		
		<p>Arch -> sudo pacman -S texlive-most</p>
		<p>Now if texlive isn't available through the repositories it will be a little more complicated. Run these commands in your terminal. If you wish to grab a more updated zip file grab it directly from their website, the date at the time of writing this is October 11, 2019.</p>	
		<p>-> curl http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl.zip</p>
		<p>-> sudo apt install unzip</p>
		<p>-> unzip install-tl.zip</p>
		<p>-> cd install-tl-20191011</p>
		<p>-> ./install-tl -gui text</p>
		<p>Configure it as you wish and then finally we just need to add the packages to your path. To make it easy we will just add append it to your bashrc.</p>
		<p>-> sudo echo "PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2019/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc</p>
		<p>Then congratulations you have installed Latex on your computer.</p>
		<h3>Hello World</h3>
		<p>Copy and paste this into a .tex file to see if everything is working.</p>
		<p>-> \documentclass{article}<br>-><br>-> \title{My First Latex Document}<br>-> \author{Dominic Carducci}<br>-> \date{\today}<br>-><br>-> \begin{document}<br>-> <br>-> \maketitle<br>-><br>-> You've got to love this world, hello world!<br>-> <br>-> \end{document}</p>	
		<p>Then compile it with pdflatex and the program will, if correct, generate a pdf.</p>
		<p>-> pdflatex YourFile.tex</p>
		<p>This is boring you say, that's only a document you say, be patient young one. To create a presentation we will be using Latex's beamer, I will give you a basic hello world example and go through what does what. The syntax is mostly self-explanatory so too much explaining is unnecessary.</p>
		<p>-> \documentclass{beamer}<br>-><br>-> \usetheme{warsaw}<br>-><br>-> \title{My First Presentation with Beamer}<br>-> \author{Dominic Carducci}<br    >-> \date{\today}<br>-><br>-> \begin{document}<br>-><br>-> \maketitle\<br>-><br>-> \begin{frame}<br>-><br>-> Hello world<br>-><br>-> \end{frame}<br>-><br>-> \end{document}</p>	
		<p>When creating a latex document you first need to declare what kind of document you wish to create. This is the \documentclass command and for presentations we will use beamer. Next comes the \usepackage commands, I included none in the examples but with this you will be able to import what you need for your document, for example to include graphics you will use the \usepackage{graphicx}. Much like python's import. Keep in mind this doesn't insert anything by itself, only gives you the ability to use the package, for if you neglected the command pdflatex would give you an error. Then going down we specify the details for the title, then in the document itself the \maketitle generates the title using Latex's default format. Lastly, the begin/end document reports to Latex that everything written in the tag shall be included in the document. The commands listed before this can be though of sorta like settings configuring your document. This makes up the most basic properties of a Latex document. To create a presentation the formats a little different but the core is still the same. Beamer instead of article, using frames, separating slides into columns, etc. First though, I need to introduce how to create lists and insert images.</p>
		<h3>Lists</h3>
		<p>The former is an ordered, and the latter unordered.</p>
		<p>-> \begin{enumerate}<br>-><br>-> \item{one}<br>-> \item{two}<br>-> \item{three}<br>-><br>-> \end{enumerate}</p>
		<p>Notice, like html, you have to close everything you open.</p>
		<p>-> \begin{itemize}<br>-><br>-> \item{one}<br>-> \item{two}<br>-> \item{two}<br>-> \item{three}<br>-><br>-> \end{itemize}</p>		
		<h3>Images</h3>
		<p>Remember is we want to import an image we need the graphicx package. To do that just type in \usepackage{graphicx} at the top of your document.</p>
		<p>-> \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{\path\to\image}</p>
		<h3>Creating Slides</h3>
		<p>If you want to create different slides you need to insert a begin/end frame. Whatever information you wish to put in there goes, though since presentations are usually bullet pointed you'd usually use an unordered list. Remember each frame is a seperate slide.</p>
		<p>-> \begin{frame}<br>-><br>-> \begin{enumerate}<br>-><br>-> \item{one}<br>-> \item{two}<br>-> \item{three}<br>-><br>-> \end{enumerate}<br>-><br>-> \end{frame}</p>
		<p>If we want to create a title slide all we have todo is use the same \maketitle command expect instead of the frame we wish to put it, presumably the one. Also, if you want to give your slide a title just include it in parentheses after the \begin{frame}.</p>
		<p>-> \begin{frame}{Title}<br>-><br>-> \maketitle<br>-><br>-> \end{frame}</p>
		<p>Simple enough, no?</p>
		<h3>Columns</h3>
		<p>This is the last topic we'll cover, this allows you to format your slide in a way that allows for you to have a bulleted list on one side, and an image on the other.</p>
		<p>-> \begin{frame}{Columns}<br>-> \begin{columns}<br>-> \column{0.6\textwidth}<br>-><br>-> \begin{itemize}<br>-> \item{one}<br>-> \item{two}<br>-> \end{itemize}<br>-> \column{0.4\textwidth}<br>-> \begin{enumerate}<br>-> \item{Buckle my}<br>-> \item{shoe}<br>-> \end{enumerate}<br>-><br>-> \end{columns}<br>-> \end{frame}</p>
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>I got nothing to say, awesome conclusion, I know.</p>
