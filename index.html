		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>This website holds a collection of three different tutorials which will include the basic syntax of both HTML and Latex, then the third will be an introduction to the terminal. This will serve as my final project for intersession, and the main design themes will be a focus on minimalism and keeping it aesthetically pleasing. Lastly, for the two people who don't understand, the headers serve as links to the three seperate guides.</p>
		<h3 id="PaddedH3">-> <a href="langhtml.html">HTML</a></h3>	
		<p id="PaddedParagraph">This is the markup language for the web. It's pretty basic and intuitive, and couples nice with css. We will cover the basic html tags, and then how to link and make use of the css file.</p>
		<h3 id="PaddedH3">-> <a href="latex.html">Latex</a></h3>
		<p id="PaddedParagraph">Latex is a markup language, similiar to HTML in that regard, but its focus is on creating documents and presentations. Latex is very nice because it automatically formats and generates the entire document for you. Also, you can ditch those monolithic office suites for more sane alternatives like Texmaker or, better yet, vim.</p>
		<h3 id="PaddedH3">-> <a href="terminal.html">Terminal</a></h3>
		<p id="PaddedParagraph">This will introduce both why you should use the terminal, and show off the basics to get the reader started. This means navigating the filesystem, editing/appending to files, and customizing the shell. After that I'm also going to throw in an apt tutorial, to update and install packages from the command line. Please note though that this will only work for Debian based distros.</p>
